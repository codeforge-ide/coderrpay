# Civic Auth Integration

This project implements a modular authentication system that supports Civic Auth (for Web3 + GitHub authentication) and Appwrite (for traditional authentication), with seamless fallbacks.

## Features

### âœ… Completed Integration


- **Dual Authentication**: 
  - **Civic Enabled**: GitHub login via Civic + Web3 wallet creation

   - `hooks/` - useCivicAuth hook
   - `providers/` - CivicAuthProvider wrapper
   - `types/` - TypeScript interfaces
   - `utils/` - Configuration helpers

2. **`src/integrations/appwrite/`** - Appwrite-Civic bridge
   - `civic-auth.ts` - Sync Civic users to Appwrite

3. **`src/integrations/fallback/`** - Fallback components
